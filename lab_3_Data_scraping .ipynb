It won “Best British Single” at the 1991 Brit Awards.\\nIn 2010, Pitchfork placed it at #15 on their Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s. Rolling Stone described it as “sensually serene”.\\nRolling Stone placed the song in the 415th place of the 500 best songs of all time, quoting the making of the song:\\nIt was kind of half a song,” Gahan said. “And Alan and Flood, who was producing the album, had this idea to put a beat to it.” When Martin Gore added the guitar, that was it.\\nVocalist Dave Gahan explained that “Enjoy The Silence” began as a “very slow, ballad-y couple of verses” but bandmate Alan Wilder and producer Flood converted it into the danceable new wave hit it became. At first, songwriter Martin Gore was initially not on board with the uptempo rewrite.\\nI thought the very nature of the song was, you know, enjoy the silence, so it ought to have a very serene atmosphere. It took me a while to get used to the idea, but as we took it further that way with the guitar riff, it really pulled together.Expand +141ShareAsk us a question about this songAsk a question *\\u200cAre there differences between the album and single versions of the song?Genius Answer1 contributorYes, and no. The single version is 4:15, compared to the album length of 6:12. However, aside from the additional acapella outro on the album version, the 2 versions are the same.\\nOn the album, the 2 minutes following the outro are actually the hidden track “Interlude #2 (Crucified)”.\\nAdditionally, the video features another version of the song with an extended intro (available to listen to at the bottom of this page), which is essentially the instrumental of the song’s outro stripped back.What have the artists said about the song?Genius Answer2 contributorsDave Gahan declared in an interview for Entertainment Weekly in March 2017:\\nFunny enough, when Martin first came up with a demo for ‘Silence,’ it was kind of half a song. Just a piano and these very slow, ballad-y couple of verses. And Alan [Wilder] and Flood, who was producing the album, had this idea to put a beat to it. They said, ‘Get out of the studio and come back in two days.’ When we came back, Flood said to Martin, ‘I need you to come up with a guitar line,’ so Martin started to play this riff, and that was it. Then he said ‘Dave, go sing,’ and I did. We literally recorded it in a couple of days. Then we started messing with the song, trying to make it more than it was, and it never needed more. We put it out like that, and I think we knew between us that there was something very special about it, but we had no idea what a huge hit it was going to be.\\nAlan Wilder recalled:\\nStrangely, the thing that immediately came to mind was that I could hear Neil Tennant singing it in my head. Something about the line “All I ever wanted” sounded very hamster…..er…. Pet Shop to me. Most DM songs changed tempo to some degree from the original demo although none I can think of have been that extreme.\\nMartin’s demos always had a complete set of lyrics but musically they varied from sometimes being quite detailed to sometimes very simplistic. I felt that to have taken the simple ballad approach for this song would have been to criminally pass on it’s massive commercial potential. It was a great tune crying out for the kind of treatment it eventually got. Flood and I worked on the backing track before calling Martin in to play the guitar riff. As the track came together, I think it dawned on everyone (even Martin, who had been the most reluctant about taking the up-tempo route) that we had a hit on our hands.What is the meaning of the music video?Genius Answer2 contributorsDave Gahan declared in an interview for Entertainment Weekly in March 2017:\\nAnton (Corbijn) came to me — he’s Dutch you know — and said, ‘So Dave, I have an idea. You’re gonna wear a crown. You’re this king walking everywhere, and you’re gonna carry a deck chair…’ And I didn’t get it at all. But once we started and he showed me the footage I got what he was doing: The man who has everything, but really feels nothing. And we were in such remote places — like, five miles up in the Alps walking in the snow, in the Algarve in Portugal on these remote beaches, at Balmoral in Scotland, where we could walk for days and days and not see anyone.WHAT IS THIS SONG ALL ABOUTViolator (1990)Depeche Mode1.
